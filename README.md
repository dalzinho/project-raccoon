# project-raccoon

## Description
A model of a football club website. The frontend is written in React.js, while the server-side element is written in node.js.

## Details
The server side scrapes league, fixture and results data from a third party, parses that information into JSON then serves it as a local API.

## to-do

* Take information from club twitter account and display on home page
* Include a news feature that allows blog-style posts to be added, with a feed of recent posts shown on the front page
* extend clubs API to hold all West Region clubs
* store league information in a database rather than as a file
